This Repo is solely for the development of Themes for the Open-Source Blogging CMS: Anchor.

Please feel free to create your own themes for the project.

This repo contains the default and boilerplate themes, this should provide you with enough aid to create your own themes. Please use the boilerplate as a template, but make sure that you do not overwrite it.
