AS OF SAT 11/02/2012 SOME OF THESE THEMES MAY NOT SUPPORT 0.5, WE ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THEM.

This Repo is solely for the development of Themes for the Open-Source Blogging CMS: Anchor.

Please feel free to create your own themes for the project.

This repo contains the default and boilerplate themes, this should provide you with enough aid to create your own themes. Please use the boilerplate as a template, but make sure that you do not overwrite it.

If you unsure about how to do something, check out the docs! (Link below)

Happy themeing!
